<a id="who-we-are" class="anchor" href="#who-we-are" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who we are</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Cherrybomb studios (Reffered to CBS from now on) is the improved version of the former games comapny, Orange Cube Games (The company died due to naming issues. however the old OCG squad is till together, if not stronger.) We are made up of 3 core members - Harry West (Marketing, Buissness solutions and Resource Management), Sebastian Gluch (Game Developmer, Head of Public Relations, Backend & Front-end software design and Backend & Front-end network programmer) and Harry Barnes (Head of Artistical expressions and "<em>Sprite maker of <strong>DOOM!</strong></em>"). However there is one more "<em>member</em>" of CBS; Harry West's proud Girlfriend - "Izzy", who is head of Human Resources, Human Management and Parties.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We've changed our vision from the flat <em>"Let's bring back the 80's classics, 'cause why the hell not?"</em> to our updated vision of game development; <strong>"Gameplay first, Moddability soon after and lastly performance."</strong> meaning that we make a bunch of tech-demos and libraries to help others on their quest to become a game developer / game development studio.</p>


<h2>
<a id="our-game-engine" class="anchor" href="#our-game-engine" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Game Engine</h2>

<p>We've made quick work to remove our previous engines from our memory and focused on "<em><strong>Scorpin</strong>2D</em>".</p>

<h3>
<a id="source-2d" class="anchor" href="#source-2d" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scorpin2D</h3>

<p>We've tweaked absolutely <strong>everything</strong> from our last revision of S2D; now it is a fully-functional game engine, running super-efficiently in the Java Programming language and mass compability with our quick-load libraries.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we've released a bunch of those, such as <strong>"RPGLib, FLUtil, DockPort and MMODLoader"</strong> to name a few.</p>

<a id="places-of-release" class="anchor" href="#places-of-release" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Places of release</h2>

<h3>
<a id="steam-store" class="anchor" href="#steam-store" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Steam Store</h3>

<p>( Mainly Greenlight, unless Valve feels nice )</p>

<h3>
<a id="this-website" class="anchor" href="#this-website" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This website</h3>

<p>Under <strong>/games/</strong>; there will be links to the code.google.com repo's. <em>Disclamer: We post the DEMO's and/or BETA's of the game there if the game gets on Steam. If it doesn't then we'll be only posting BETA's there ( until the game is good enough to get on Greenlight ).</em></p>

<a id="who-we-are" class="anchor" href="#who-we-are" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who we are</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Orange Cube Games ( referred to as OCG from now on ) is a group of friends that decided to make games for fun. Currently there are 4 members of OCG, and 3 members of the sub-divisional group OCS ( Orange Cube Studios, the people who make our websites look slightly more professional then the OCG itself, they also make music for our games and manage our social networks ).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OCG mainly focuses on bringing back the 20th century games back to modern life. We also specialize in 16&amp;32-bit games, however we also do games-on-request.</p>


<h2>
<a id="our-game-engine" class="anchor" href="#our-game-engine" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Game Engine</h2>

<p>We have two game engines to date; as listed below.</p>

<h3>
<a id="oe---orange-engine" class="anchor" href="#oe---orange-engine" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OE - Orange Engine</h3>

<p>Focuses on quicker projects that are highly customizable; however it lacks in many key features ( such as animation and multiplayer compatibility ).</p>

<h3>
<a id="co---comedy-orange" class="anchor" href="#co---comedy-orange" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CO - Comedy Orange</h3>

<p>A packet of dll's that are used in other game engines ( such as Unity ), and a couple of JAR's for Java games ( which we used to do, until some issues with the formats we use and how inefficient / demanding Java is.</p>

<h2>
<a id="places-of-release" class="anchor" href="#places-of-release" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Places of release</h2>

<h3>
<a id="steam-store" class="anchor" href="#steam-store" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Steam Store</h3>

<p>( Mainly Greenlight, unless Valve feels nice )</p>

<h3>
<a id="this-website" class="anchor" href="#this-website" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This website</h3>

<p>Under <strong>/games/</strong>; there will be links to the code.google.com repo's. <em>Disclamer: We post the DEMO's and/or BETA's of the game there if the game gets on Steam. If it doesn't then we'll be only posting BETA's there ( until the game is good enough to get on Greenlight ).</em></p>
